 ### Personal projects, to be added in a page later
Many small projects were made without version control software. May they rest in peace. As for the others, some are public and some are private; if you are interested in one of them and want to see my code, just let me know :)

1. Simple BGP router written in Python, written for my Networks class. Accomplishes all of the essential functions of a real router, i.e., accepting route announcements from simulated peer routers, generating new route announcements for  peer routers, 
managing and compressing a forwarding table, and forwarding data packets that arrive from simulated internet users.
