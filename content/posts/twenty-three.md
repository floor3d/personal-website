The title of this post would lead you to believe that I am a fan of the phrase, "It all works out" or "It'll work itself out" or "It'll figure itself out" or ... etc. There are many ways to say it, but I hate any derivative of that phrase. Let me explain why.


The idea of "It will work out in the end" (I don't want to type that thirty times so I'll refer to it as 'the phrase' from now on) is that, even if you are going through some tough times or hit a big obstacle, at some point in the future you will be past the obstacle or be past the tough times. Frankly, there's nothing wrong with that. But the undertones of the phrase bother me.


I'm nitpicking, but the phrase sounds a whole lot like "It will fix itself" and not a whole lot like "You will be able to fix it." A different person might take the phrase as "It will work out in the end because you will be able to fix it later," but then why wouldn't the phrase be, "You will work it out in the end" ? The issue I have with this phrase it that it takes the reality out of the issue. It's not that it will fix itself, but rather YOU will do everything in your power to fix it, and then you will succeed. But to say anything other than that would be to discount the work that you put into solving your problems. 


While unfair, I find it offensive to hear this phrase if I am facing an issue. It is in good faith, but I strongly believe that it is a misleading and untrue phrase. I know what I know, am where I am, and do what I do out of my own work ethic and volition. I am not where I am because things "worked themselves out." I am here because I did what I had to do and made sacrifices so that I could succeed. Things don't just work out; you make them work out. And frankly, in many cases, things simply don't work out. To say that they always find a way to do so also discounts this reality, as I said earlier. 


I'll try to summarize my beliefs about this phrase in a few simple points. I take phrases like this literally, which is probably not how they're supposed to be taken. Nonetheless, this is the way I think, so I will explain it from my perspective. This phrase, in my eyes:
1. is a cop out which ignores the reality that things don't always work out, and 
2. disregards hard work undergone and sacrifices made by someone so that they succeed


This is why I take offense to this phrase. You may disagree 100% with everything I just said. My mind may change in the future, but for now, I am content with dying on this hill.
