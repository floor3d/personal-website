          Recently, I stumbled upon a new YouTuber named Mental Outlaw. He makes videos ranging from cryptocurrency to internet privacy to Linux distros and beyond. He is incredibly knowledgeable and all of his videos are extremely informative and also pretty funny.

          He has a lot of great views on software and privacy, for example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Proprietary, closed-source software is spyware.
            </li>
            <li>
              Open-source software (as well as open-source forks of software, like Librewolf [forked off Firefox]) is both more secure and private.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vim > your favorite bloatware/spyware IDE
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested in internet security and privacy as well as his takes on recent happenings (such as the Silicon Valley Bank failure), I would really recommend his channel. I have already learned a lot from him (my VPN rant was based off his videos) and will continue to learn from his channel.
