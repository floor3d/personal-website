After years of studying on and off, I finally took my Security+ exam, and passed. Frankly, I am really happy that I studied for Security+ for years, even if I wasn't consistent about it. The fact that I started early and took my time with it gave me a wonderful knowledge baseline that was extremely helpful for not only some of my classes but also just general knowledge that every security professional needs to know. From encryption to hashing to degaussing, a lot of the security knowledge I have now started with my studying for the Security+ exam. I used books, Professor Messer, online tests, etc. All of it was useful in studying for the exam. It feels odd to only really have an extra word on my resume after all of that studying and money spent on the exam, but the knowledge I have today is enough to show for it. Security+ has also given me the important knowledge of figuring out what I don't want to do, including but not limited to: compliance, governance, policy, threat intelligence, etc. I would prefer a more technical role when I work a security job.
