On Saturday, Dec 2, CTF Club, NUWiCyS, and NUSecurity collaborated to put on Northeastern's biggest ever student-led security event, SUB-Z3R0 CTF. I have never organized such a large event -- over 60 people came to take on the challenge.


It was an honor to have been a leader of the team that organized this event. From making challenges to applying for funds to booking the room, I got to help run the show for this event. It was great to see the payoffs from leading a team; it was months and months of work that culminated into just a few hours.


Due to the success of this event, it will not be the last one. Bigger and better things are coming in the spring!
