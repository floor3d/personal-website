This past weekend, the [Northeastern Collegiate Cyber Defense Team](https://nuccdc.club) sent some of the members down to Chicago to participate in the [Cyberforce](https://cyberforce.energy.gov/cyberforce-competition/) competition. I was one of the students sent to this competition.


We ended up placing **9th out of 107** teams. Pretty solid result! It was not quite as I had imagined; I expected to mostly be defending my machine (I was in charge of the DC), but it was much more based on solving *anomalies* (basically ctf challenges) and solving forensics-type challenges ("Red Team just got into your PLC server, what did they do and how did they get in?"). 


Despite the fact that it was not what I expected, it was fun and I'd love to go back next year. I still am quite unexperienced with Windows security but I am trying my best to learn as much as I can, especially before CCDC!


This upcoming weekend (Nov 11 and 12) is the [CPTC](https://cp.tc) competition. I'm excited for what's to come.
