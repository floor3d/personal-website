          Before the internet, we were told to not talk to strangers, and never give any information to them about where you live or who you are. Then the internet came, and people began doing live face calls on Omegle.com on a peer-to-peer connection. What could go wrong?

          Unsurprisingly, a lot. Back when I was in high school, my friend notified me of something he had seen on YouTube that took advantage of this great security misstep. Of course, we had to try it out. It started with a program I had never heard of called Wireshark; I learned that this was a software that would show you the data being sent and received on your network. At least, that was my understanding of it, and that's all I really had to know. For me, the beauty of Wireshark in relation to Omegle was that it revealed the IP address of your Omegle partner. I didn't care a single bit about any data being sent across. So, we began to try this thing called "Omegle Doxxing" -- in other words, telling people where they lived on Omegle calls and scaring them. We devised a foolproof plan that worked nearly every time.
          <ol>
            <li> Step one: INITIATE. Get on a call with someone. </li>
            <li> Step two: DISTRACT. My friend would start up a conversation with them to keep them busy and unsuspecting of any teenage shenanigans and tomfoolery.</li>
            <li> Step three: EXECUTE. I would open up Wireshark, sniff incoming packets, and identify their IP address. </li>
            <li> Step four: LOCATE. I would put the IP address into an IP geolocator, and note down where they were from </li>
            <li> Step five: GET CREATIVE. It was now a free for all. Depending on the victim, we would either convince them we were from the same neighborhood and that we recognized them, acted like they were famous and pretended to be fans, or, the most fun possibility, act like we were dangerous and going to go to their house. The scare factor was great. </li>
          </ol>
          Unknowingly, this was my first real experience with cybersecurity, if you can call it that. I would later learn more about Wireshark and its wonderful abilities, but at that point in time, I was content with convincing people online that I would come to their house.
