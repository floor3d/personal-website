### Hello Hugo
I have migrated my self-made website to Hugo, a static website generator. So far, it's been great: extremely fast, easy to use, and looks good. I also am now self-hosting the server on a cloud machine. While making these changes, I thought about improvement and change.
While migrating my blog posts to Hugo, I realized that I have learned much more since my original posts and have changed my thoughts on several things that I have said before. However, I won't remove these posts, and I may just post updates on my thoughts in the future. I want the blog to be a sort of time capsule of what my knowledge was like at that exact moment. I have already grown a lot since my posts just a few months ago, and I'm sure that this will continue in the future, as well. I hope that my improvement will show as my list of posts grows.
### Speed of Change
I believe that everyone has had a thought something like this: 
```
Man, I was so dumb back then.
``` 
I personally find myself having these kinds of thoughts all the time, even about just a couple of weeks or months ago. I didn't like it originally, but now I see it as a reflection of how quick I can grow. The more you understand (and perhaps criticise) your past views / knowledge, the more you realize that you change way faster than you think. It reminds me of this quote, by C.S. Lewis:
```
Isn't it funny how day by day nothing changes, but when you look back everything is different?
```
I love the feeling of looking back and seeing how my knowledge has changed. As I said, this blog will be evidence of my knowledge at different stages of my life. I'm looking forward to seeing the improvement.
